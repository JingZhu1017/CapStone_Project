# CapStone_Project
Natural Language Processing and Sentiment Analysis for Support Desk Comment Revie (Python)
# Background & Data Sources
This project was developed as a part of Course work by a team of 5 students at George Mason University in association with Accenture Federal Services.
# Problem Statement
1) Users provide feedback via surveys about their experience with the services provided by the Support Desk.
2) Due to the vast amount of survey data, the Support Team is unable to read/process all the responses and thus some level of automation is needed.
3) Text mining / sentiment analysis algorithms can be applied to efficiently analyze the survey data.
4) Analysis findings can be summarized in dashboards to support strategic decision making by management to help improve Support Desk services.
